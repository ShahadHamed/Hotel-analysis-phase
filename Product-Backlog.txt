2. PRODUCT BACKLOG DEVELOPMENT (Hotel System)
Definition and Purpose

The product backlog is a prioritized list of all work required for the HMS, guiding development to deliver the highest-value features first.

Backlog Prioritization Techniques

• Value vs. effort: Prioritize features like online booking first (high value, moderate effort)
• MoSCoW: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have
• Risk-based: Critical features for guest satisfaction or revenue get higher priority
