4. WEIGHTING AND ESTIMATION (Hotel System)
Purpose of Story Estimation

Helps determine effort, complexity, and sprint planning.

Why Story Points Instead of Hours?

Relative estimation is easier than predicting exact hours. For example: “Booking a room online is simpler than generating a monthly revenue report.”

Story Point Scale

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100
• 1–3 = simple
• 5–8 = moderate
• 13+ = complex

Factors Affecting Story Points

• Complexity (logic, workflows)
• Workload (number of screens, data entry)
• Technical uncertainty (API integration, payment gateway)
• Risks (guest satisfaction, security, privacy compliance)
